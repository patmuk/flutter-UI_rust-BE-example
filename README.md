# flutter-rust-bridge_crux_style

THis is a setup of [flutter-rust-bridge](https://github.com/fzyzcjy/flutter_rust_bridge) following its [guide](https://cjycode.com/flutter_rust_bridge/tutorial_with_flutter.html) with small amendments to follow the idea of [crux](https://github.com/redbadger/crux).

Feel free to use this as a starting template. I hope this helps the curx project to implement a flutter target.
